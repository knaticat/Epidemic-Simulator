# Epidemic Simulator
A simple p5.js Epidemic Simulator.
Keeping in mind the current COVID-19 pandemic this is an educational simulation based on the SIRD model of infection spread. Aim of the project 
was to observe the effect such pandemics have on the older population of a community.
# Features
1. Social Distancing: Introducing "Social Distancing" a strategy many of you might be familiar with from Social Media, televisions or the newspapers. In the simulation, I have added this as a repulsion force experienced if an individual seems to approach closer to the infection radius of any fellow individual. Tweak around!
2. Age Group in Population: Aimed to bring up how such epidemics are dangerous to senior citizens (60 yrs or above)/ immunocompromised patients. The simulation handles this risk by keeping a higher mortality rate for such category of people.
3. Central Location crowding:  People usually don't roam cluelessly around the city, they tend to gather around a central location, a common destination. 
4. Quarantine Zone: Most effective approach: Identify and isolate infected humans. To be realistic infected people have certain chance to get isolated, accounts for cases when individual is infected but is not isolated as he/she does not show symptoms of the disease.
5. Community Travel:People tend to form communities and with the present age of globalization it perfectly fits to simulate conditions of travel among different communities. The community mode organizes people into four communities and after some interval of days individuals travel across other communities. 
# Inspiration and Framework
Inspired from 3B1B video "Simulating an Epidemic" and ideas acquired from the Youtube Channel "The Coding Train".
Framework based on p5.js.
